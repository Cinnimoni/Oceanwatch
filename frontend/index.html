                    The mission of Oceanwatch is to develop a sea monitoring program that will help to prevent unsupervised and potentially dangerous activities in the ocean from going unnoticed.

                    The core idea is to monitor ship activity by comparing data in real-time and historical timeframe and store them in special database.
